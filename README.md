# Case Study Insights: Yoga-Based Interventions in Mental and Musculoskeletal Disorders

This repository contains structured healthcare case studies conducted as part of my M.Sc. in Yoga Therapy at SVYASA Yoga University. These projects integrate qualitative data collection, clinical observation, and outcome measurement with a focus on mental health and chronic pain management.

# Case Study 1: Cyclothymia (Mood Disorder)

•	Assessed a 25-year-old data analyst with cyclothymic symptoms and family history of bipolar disorder.
•	Collected bio-psycho-social history, tracked behavioral symptoms, and identified key triggers (stress, sleep, lifestyle).
•	Designed a yoga-based intervention plan (IAYT module) with breathing, meditation, and Ayurvedic support.
•	Outcome: Reduction in stress and mood instability, improved anthropometric parameters, and positive patient feedback.

 # Case Study 2: Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP)
 
•	Evaluated a 28-year-old software engineer with chronic non-specific back pain exacerbated by occupational stress and sedentary lifestyle.
•	Implemented a structured yoga therapy protocol targeting physical, psychological, and dietary factors.
•	Outcome: Noticeable pain reduction, increased mobility, and improved well-being reported by the participant.

# Key Skills Demonstrated

•	Clinical data collection and case documentation
•	Interpretation of psychological and physiological metrics
•	Designing and evaluating holistic intervention strategies
•	Communicating outcomes through structured reporting and visualization

**These projects reflect my ability to combine clinical reasoning, data interpretation, and outcome-based reporting, foundational for roles in Healthcare Analytics, especially those focused on wellness, mental health, and integrative therapies.
